# MathLibz

MathLibz is a full stack web application that allows users to generate math problems catered to their own settings. It was designed with the intention to help decrease workload and time spent by teachers, tutors, parents, etc. in coming up with practice problems. The full application can be viewed [here](https://www.MathLibz.com).

The code is split into three repositories, one for the [front end](https://github.com/nathanjpak/MathLib), one for the [back end](https://github.com/nathanjpak/MathLib-server) and one for the [API](https://github.com/nathanjpak/MathLib). Feel free to visit each of those links for a closer look.
