# Trello Clone

This was a full stack web application that mirrors the functionality of Trello, a popular workflow management tool. It was built by myself alongside members of Parsity's 5th Cohort as a Capstone project. I served as the front end lead and made most of the decisions regarding the front end, including the use of Redux to manage state across components. Unfortunately, this app is no longer deployed following the cessation of Heroku's free tier.
