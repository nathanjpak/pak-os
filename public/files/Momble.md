# Momble

Momble is a fullstack web application that aims to gamify English language learning, especially for second language learners. It was inspired by people like my mother, whose native language is not English and enjoys using her brain on games like this.

It is built with React on the front end and Node.js on the back end. Typescript was the language used throughout the project, in order to have type-safe development. Web-socket protocols were used to allow for real-time multiplayer communication in games like Hangman.
